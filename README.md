# pbrocks-wp-app

## `wp-env`

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites: Docker

For more info: [block-editor/reference-guides](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-env/#prerequisites)

### Install `wp-env` locally

Install as a global npm package on your local machine.

```sh
npm -g i @wordpress/env
```

### Startup config `.wp-env-json`

This plugin comes with a preconfigured in the root directory. Alter as needed. If left unchanged, this plugin will create an environment that runs on port 4266, as in: `http://localhost:4266`.

### To set up environment

After ensuring Docker is running and the `@wordpress/env` is installed, type:

```sh
wp-env start
```

This will configure a local WordPress environment using Docker and when set up, return the URLs to access both the development and testing environments.

To end your session, type:

```sh
wp-env stop
```

### Splash Screen

```
